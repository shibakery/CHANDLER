**Research Notice**: This document outlines the theoretical mathematical framework underlying CHANDLER's development.

## Core Mathematical Components

### Challenge Types (Under Validation)
- TOKEN_METRICS: Value validation (weight: 1.0x)
- SECURITY: Edge protection (weight: 1.1x)
- EFFICIENCY: Pattern optimization (weight: 1.2x)
- NETWORK: Graph properties (weight: 1.3x)
- VALIDATION: Proof verification (weight: 1.4x)

### Mathematical Bounds
```
Market_Value(v) ∈ [0,1000]
Total_Cap = 6M vertices
Challenge_Impact(c) ≤ (1000 - Current_Value(v))
```

### Edge Evolution Formula
```
edge_strength_growth = min(
    current_strength * (1 + (quality_score * type_weights[type])),
    MAX_EDGE_STRENGTH
)
```

### Success Metrics (Research Targets)
- Recognition: 99% accuracy
- Learning: 95% efficiency
- Evolution: 90% improvement

## Research Status
All mathematical models and formulas are under active research and require formal validation. Performance metrics are theoretical targets subject to verification.

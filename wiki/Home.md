# CHANDLER Mathematical Framework

**Research Notice**: This documentation describes a theoretical mathematical framework under active development and validation.

## Core Research Focus
- Mathematical proofs for network properties
- Validation frameworks and completeness proofs
- Challenge system formalization
- Edge evolution equations
- Network stability theorems

## Research Status
- All components require validation
- Mathematical models under development
- Performance metrics are research targets
- Real-world behavior may vary

## Framework Components
- [[Mathematical-Proofs]]
- [[Validation-Framework]]
- [[Challenge-Arena]]
- [[Edge-Evolution]]
- [[Network-Theorems]]

## Foundation
Built upon the theoretical foundations established in [[WILL]], CHANDLER represents the next evolution in our research, focusing on mathematical formalization and proof validation.

## Research Disclaimer
All features, metrics, and mathematical models described in this documentation are theoretical and under active research. No claims of performance or capability are made without explicit validation.

# Research Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT**: All content in the CHANDLER documentation describes theoretical mathematical frameworks and models under active research and development.

## Research Status
- All mathematical proofs require formal validation
- Network properties are theoretical constructs
- Performance metrics are research targets
- Implementation details subject to change
- Real-world behavior may vary significantly

## Validation Requirements
- Mathematical completeness proofs
- Network stability theorems
- Edge evolution formulas
- Challenge type weights
- Success metrics validation

## Current Limitations
- Theoretical framework stage
- Proofs under development
- Models require verification
- Performance needs validation
- Implementation in research phase

## Documentation Standards
All documentation must:
- Lead with research status
- Clearly state theoretical nature
- Specify validation requirements
- Maintain mathematical rigor
- Avoid unproven claims
- Include explicit disclaimers
